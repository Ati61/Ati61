# Sup! 👋

I'm a CS student who loves to code. Passionate about building stuff that actually works (most of the time).

## Who am I?
- 🎓 Computer Science student
- 🔭 Currently working on: A **Spotify Tracker** that lets me obsess over my terrible music taste
- 💻 Jack of all trades, master of none: Frontend, backend, whatever needs building
- ☕ Fueled by coffee and Stack Overflow
- 🌐 Portfolio: [atixd.me](https://atixd.me)

## Tech I mess around with
- React (when I need to make things pretty)
- Java & C# (when I need to get serious)
- C (when I want to question my life choices)
- Kotlin (my new obsession)
- Whatever else the project demands

## Current Projects
- 🎵 **Spotify Stats Thing**: Analyzing my embarrassing listening habits and making playlists I'll never actually listen to
- Random experiments that may or may not see the light of day
- Whatever assignment is due next week
